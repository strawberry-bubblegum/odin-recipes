This is part of TOP Foundations. It is the "Recipes" project.

It is a basic collection of HTML webpages, consisting of a Home page linking three recipes: chicken 
parmesan, chocolate chip cookies, and orange jam.

It allowed me to practice linking pages within the website, as well as having an external link.
For the external link, I used HTML attributes "target" and "rel" to securely and privately open the 
website in a new tab.

For each recipe page, I had an image of the finished recipe, a short description, the ingredient list,
and the steps to complete it. This was good practice for organizing different folders for different parts
of the website, such as all the images being in a separate folder. I also added "alt" attribute to all 
of them for description in case the image didn't load and for accessibility purposes. I also had to play
around with the "width" attribute to scale the images properly for each webpage, since the default sizes
varied and looked differently on the webpage. 

Overall, a slightly tough but satisfying project. The result is a crude website but it has all the main
components there.
