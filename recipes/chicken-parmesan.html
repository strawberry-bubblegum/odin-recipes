        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a chicken parmesan recipe inspired by 
            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223042/chicken-parmesan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">allrecipes.com</a>. 
            Unlike restaurant versions, this one is not drenched in sauce and cheese. 
            This recipe yields two servings.
        </p>
        <p>The breading will retain crispiness, and if you desire more sauce or cheese, you can add it
            as you (or your guests) wish, after it has cooked. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>bread-crumbs</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>tomato sauce</li>
            <li>mozzarella</li>
            <li>basil</li>
            <li>grated provolone cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pound breasts to be about 1/2 inch thick</li>
            <li>Add flour to bowl large enough to fit breast; add pepper</li>
            <li>Crack eggs in another bowl and whisk</li>
            <li>Add bread-crumbs to another large bowl and add grated parmesan</li>
            <li>Take each breast, dip and cover it in the flour, egg, and then the bread-crumbs</li>
            <li>Cover a pan with olive oil and heat it just under when it begins to smoke</li>
            <li>Fry the chicken breasts in the pan. Add butter while frying to ensure the oil does
                not evaporate
            </li>
            <li>Move the fried breasts to an oiled or buttered pan. Add mozzarella and parmesan on them</li>
            <li>Broil/cook the breasts only long enough for the cheese to melt</li>
            <li>Serve the breasts with pasta sauce either above or below</li>
            <li>Optional: Serve along with pasta (this is common)</li>
